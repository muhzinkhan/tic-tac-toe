## Overview

The Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a classic, command-line interface (CLI) implementation of the popular two-player game.
It provides a simple and interactive gaming experience where two players take turns to mark a grid
with their respective symbols (X or O) with the goal of achieving a winning pattern.

## Features

## Gameplay

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to mark a square with their symbol (X or O).
